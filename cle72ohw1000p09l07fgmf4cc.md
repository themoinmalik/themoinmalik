# Spring Framework interview Questions for Beginners.

Here are some common Spring Framework interview questions:

1. What is Spring Framework?  
    Spring is a widely used open-source application framework for building enterprise-grade Java applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.
    
2. What are the features of Spring Framework?  
    Some of the key features of Spring Framework include inversion of control, aspect-oriented programming, data access, messaging, and testing.
    
3. What is Dependency Injection?  
    Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that is used to manage the dependencies between objects. In Spring Framework, DI is implemented using Inversion of Control (IoC) container. It provides loose coupling between components, which allows easier unit testing and makes the code more maintainable and flexible.
    
4. What is Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)?  
    Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to separate concerns in a program. It is used to add additional behavior to the application without modifying the existing code. In Spring Framework, AOP is used to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management.
    
5. What is Spring Boot?  
    Spring Boot is a popular extension of Spring Framework that is used to simplify the development and deployment of Spring-based applications. It provides a pre-configured environment that allows developers to focus on writing business logic instead of configuring the application.
    
6. What is the difference between Spring MVC and Spring Boot?  
    Spring MVC is a module of Spring Framework that is used for building web applications. It provides a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture that separates the application into three components: model, view, and controller. Spring Boot is a standalone framework that is used to simplify the development and deployment of Spring-based applications. It provides pre-configured environment that allows developers to focus on writing business logic instead of configuring the application.
    
7. What is the purpose of Spring Data?  
    Spring Data is a module of Spring Framework that is used to simplify the implementation of data access layer. It provides a consistent and unified API for interacting with various data stores such as databases, NoSQL stores, and cloud services.
    
8. What is Spring Security?  
    Spring Security is a module of Spring Framework that is used to provide security to Spring-based applications. It provides a wide range of security features such as authentication, authorization, and access control.
    
9. What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository ?@Component, @Service, and @Repository are all stereotypes in Spring Framework that are used to define the role of a class in the application. The @Component stereotype is used to mark a class as a component of the application, @Service is used to mark a class as a service, and @Repository is used to mark a class as a repository.
    
10. What is Spring Cloud?
    
    Spring Cloud is a set of tools and frameworks that is used to build cloud-native applications. It provides a wide range of features such as service discovery, configuration management, and circuit breaker pattern.
